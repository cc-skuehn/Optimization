# Optimization
Optimization Routines for codecentric blog articles

This repo contains a number of basic optimization routines. New routines are added as the blog series progresses. We apply these routines to different "toy" or test examples in order to illustrate their performance depending on the specific problem to solve. Finally - as a real-world application - we intend to train a Collaborative Filtering Recommender System, a methodology that will be introduced in the blog series as well.
